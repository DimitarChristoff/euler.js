Project Euler.js
================

Quick hacks done with one aim: shortest possible code. All optimisations are manual, no closure or anything suchlike.

Feel free to fork and contribute solutions or improve on existing ones. Solutions need to work under ES5 spec / node.js,
IE support is not something that matters.

To run quickly:
```sh
$ node problem-1.js
233168 64
```

Although, you are ok to use in a browser where applicable.
